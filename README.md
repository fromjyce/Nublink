# Nublink üîí

A secure, self-hosted file-sharing CLI with self-destructing links. Built with Go.

## Features ‚ú®

- **End-to-end encryption** (AES-GCM)
- **Self-destructing links** (time-based or one-time download)
- **No cloud dependencies** - your machine is the server
- **TLS-secured transfers** (auto-generated certificates)
- **Lightweight** (~10MB binary)

## Installation ‚ö°

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fromjyce/Nublink.git
cd Nublink
go build -o nublink ./cmd/nublink/
```

### Using `go install`
```bash
go install github.com/fromjyce/Nublink/cmd/nublink@latest
```

### Share a file
```bash
# Time-based expiration (1 hour)
nublink share --file secret.pdf --expire 1h

# One-time download
nublink share --file confidential.txt --once
```

### Access shared files
1. Open the generated link in any browser:
   ```
   https://[YOUR_IP]:8443/download/abc123-def456
   ```
2. Bypass the SSL warning (self-signed cert)
3. File auto-deletes after download/expiry

## Network Sharing üåê
To allow others on your local network to access files:

1. Find your IP:
   ```bash
   # Mac/Linux
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

   # Windows
   ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"
   ```
2. Share links using your IP instead of `localhost`:
   ```
   https://[YOUR_IP]:8443/download/abc123-def456
   ```
